    Run Command Prompt as Administrator.
    To back up the registry key, execute the command “reg export HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt filename“
    Execute the command “reg delete HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt /f”.

How to undo the workaround

    Run Command Prompt as Administrator.
    To restore the registry key, execute the command “reg import filename”
